        <img src="Craigslist.PNG" alt="Image of Craiglist site" width="400"><br>
        <p> Craiglist's website is an example of bad web design because it is non-responsive. If you resize the window
          it just cuts off part of the page instead of cropping the page to the size of the window.<br> Link to <a

        <img src="Slack.png" alt="Image of Slack's message design" width="400">
        <p>
          Slack is an example of good web design because of its responsiveness. I use Slack every day and often have it
          minimized to about a third of my screen. But their responsive design allows me to do that and still easily
          access all of my messages and channels. In full screen, there is some additional information that is cut out
          when you shrink it but they are replaced by easy-to-click buttons that will pull up that sidebar to view it.
          While slack has mostly shifted to an app they do still have a browser version that has the same quality as the
          app.<br> Link to <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack's</a> website

        <img src="ESPN.PNG" alt="Image of ESPN's home page" width="400">
        <p>
          ESPN is an example of good web design as the website has all of the sports news that you need including thumbnails of the articles but it also has a fast load time. A lot of other news sites have slow load times due to the number of images but ESPN has found a good balance to optimize the site. The website is also easy to navigate with clear buttons to get to where you want on the site.
