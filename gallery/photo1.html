      <p class="image_caption">This is a picture of me and my family at my cousin's wedding on September 24, 2022. The
        wedding was in Syracuse, New York and it took place at a very nice barn. I really like this picture because it
        shows a snapshot of a very fun night with my family. This is also the first wedding in my extended family that
        didn't involve my immediate family. The only other weddings that we have had were for my sister, the 5th from
        the left, and my brother, the 2nd from the left. This is the first family wedding where we could all just relax
        and have a good time rather than being part of the wedding party.</p>
